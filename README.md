`$(REPO_DIR_LOCATION) $ conda env create -f conda/environment.yml`


### Running the Source Code

To run the code:

* Activate the `conda` environment you just created in the "Dependencies" section:
`$(REPO_DIR_LOCATION) $ conda activate motionPlanning2`

* Run the main python module to run all of the simulations:
`$(REPO_DIR_LOCATION) $ python main.py`
